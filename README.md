This is a dynamic web app which shows a list of products with pagination and creates a detailed page for each of the products listed.

You can find an exhaustive tutorial to how this app was made [here](https://blog.hasura.io/building-a-dynamic-listing-web-app-with-pagination-and-dynamic-pages-using-gatsby-2ddee9ec2dc3).

```

Your app will be running at `http://localhost:8000`
